## 🚀 Getting Started

Each part has its own setup instructions. Navigate to the specific part's directory for detailed information:

```bash
cd part1  # UML & Design
cd part2  # API & Business Logic
cd part3  # Database & Auth
cd part4  # Frontend
```

to see the server in action :

1. Clone the repository
2. Start the backend and frontend servers (see documentation in each part)
3. Open `index.html` in your browser
4. Get spooked! 👻

or you can use my little treat :

```bash
# 1 Clone this repo
git clone https://www.github.com/Noziop/holbertonschool-hbnb.git

# 2 Start BOTH back&front servers from a fingersnap :
cd holbertonschool-hbnb
gnome-terminal -- ./start.sh

# 3 open part4/index.html in your system's default web browser :
xdg-open part4/index.html
```

## 🧪 Testing
Each part includes its own test suite:

- Part 1: No tests, only diagrams
- Part 2: API & business logic tests
- Part 3: Database & auth tests + Part2
- Part 4: Frontend component tests

## 📚 Documentation

## From Part2 to Part3 🔮
Our haunted journey began with a simple in-memory API in Part2. Now, in Part3, we're summoning more powerful spirits:
- SQLAlchemy for persistent data storage with SQLite 🗄️
- JWT for secure authentication 🔐
- RBAC for ghostly permissions 👑
- Swagger UI for API documentation 📖

## Technical Choices 🧙‍♀️

### Poetry: The Modern Spellbook 📦
Unlike the ancient scrolls of `pip`, Poetry brings:
- Dependency resolution that actually works (no more conflicting spells!)
- Project isolation through virtual environments
- Lock file to ensure consistent installations across haunted machines
- Simple command interface (`poetry add` vs `pip install + requirements.txt`)

### Pre-commit Magic 🔮
At first, i had some trouble to figure out, but as soon as you get how it works. it's pure magic :

- Runs all these tools automatically before each commit (black/isort/flake8/pytest/generate-badges)
- Currently learning to tame these powerful spells
- Sometimes requires `--no-verify` when we're in a hurry (shh, don't tell anyone! 🤫)
- Future plans include better configuration to balance strictness with practicality

It can be very stressful, because if one tool exit with error, you won't be able to commit ans push. your work will still stay staged. but, eh quality over quantity, right ?

It was indeed some extra work and i still have room for improvment, obviously, but it was fun all the way !

you should definitly try this at ~/ (at home)

### Code Quality Guardians 🧹

#### Black: The Uncompromising Code Formatter
- Enforces a consistent code style across the entire codebase
- No more debates about formatting - Black decides!
- Example transformations:

![Black](docs/snippets/black.png)

#### isort: The Import Organizer 🎯
- Automatically sorts and groups imports
- Separates standard library, third-party, and local imports
- Keeps our spellbook (code) organized and readable

![Isort](docs/snippets/isort.png)

#### flake8: The Strict Code Guardian 👮‍♀️
- Enforces PEP 8 style guide
- Catches potential errors and code smells
- Currently causing us some headaches with pre-commit hooks! 😅
- Won't let commits through unless code meets its high standards (or if you're in a rush you can ignore verification #I_Wont_Lie)
- Includes various plugins for additional checks:
  - `flake8-docstrings`: Ensures proper documentation
  - `flake8-import-order`: Double-checks import organization
  - `flake8-bugbear`: Catches common bugs and design problems

## Implementation 💫

### Development Configuration 🌙
Our magical configuration grimoire defines different environments:

![config](docs/snippets/Hbnb-config.png)

- **Development**: Where we brew new spells safely 🧪
- **Testing**: Where we ensure our magic is stable 🔮
- **Production**: Where we deploy our enchantments to the real world ⚡
- Each realm has its own secrets and database connections 📚

### Bcrypt Password Protection 🔐
Password protection worthy of the most powerful protection spells:

![bcrypt](docs/snippets/bcrypt.png)

- Using Bcrypt for one-way hashing 🔒
- Unique salt for each password 🧂
- Secure verification without ever storing plain passwords ✨
- Configurable work factor to adapt to evolving threats 🛡️

### JWT Authentication 👻
Magical tokens to identify our ghosts:

![JWT](docs/snippets/Jwt.png)

- Signed JWT tokens for secure authentication 🎭
- Custom claims to store roles and permissions 📜
- Automatic expiration for enhanced security ⏳
- Refresh tokens for seamless user experience 🔄

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) 👑
A permission system worthy of the grandest haunted castles:

![RBAC](docs/snippets/RBAC.png)

- Three levels of permissions:
  - 👻 **Users**: Can manage their own haunted resources
  - 👑 **Admins**: Have access to all supernatural features
  - 🌍 **Public**: Limited access to public endpoints
- Magical decorators to protect our routes
- Automatic permission checking on each request
- Themed error messages to guide lost souls

### SQLite + Initial Data Seeding 🗄️

#### Our mystical Database Schema

![DBSchema](docs/Untitled%20diagram-2024-11-11-123808.png)

#### Our mystical database setup and initial haunted data:

![SQL](docs/snippets/SQL.png)

SQLite serves as our ethereal data vault:
- Lightweight yet powerful database engine 🪶
- Perfect for development and testing realms 🧪
- Single file storage for easy backup and transfer 📦
- Full SQL support for complex haunted queries ✨

![Seeding](docs/snippets/seeding-sql.png)

Initial data seeding conjures:
- Admin ghost for system management 👑
- Basic supernatural amenities 🔮

Key features:
- Automatic database initialization on first run
- Test data for different environments
- Clean separation between dev and test data
- Easy reset and refresh capabilities

Each realm (development, testing, production) has its own data vault, ensuring our ghostly experiments don't cross paths! 👻

## Installation 🏗️

### Prerequisites 📋
Before summoning our haunted API, make sure you have these magical ingredients:
- Python 3.10+ (The most ethereal version) 🐍
- Poetry (Our mystical dependency conjurer) 📜
- SQLite (Our spectral data vault) 🗄️ (you can use sqlitebrwoser !)
- A brave soul ready to face the unknown 👻
- Some dark magic knowledge (or at least Git) 🔮

### Quick Start 🚀

![QuickStart](docs/snippets/quick-start.png)

Each spell in this enchanted sequence will:
- Clone our cursed repository 📚
- Enter the haunted directory 🏰
- Install magical dependencies with Poetry 🧙‍♀️
- Prepare the ghostly database 🗃️

- Database interaction tests 📊

### Coverage Report 🎯
Through countless nights of enchantments and debugging:

![Coverage](docs/snippets/testing2.png)

Our current mystical achievements:
- 76% overall coverage 📈
- Api components well tested 🎯 (core components were tested on Part2 (94% coverage !))
- Room for more magical improvements ✨
- Stable and reliable API 🏰

*Note: Some areas still need more enchantments, but we're proud of our current magical prowess!* 🧙‍♀️

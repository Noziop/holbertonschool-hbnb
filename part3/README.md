## From Part2 to Part3 🔮
Our haunted journey began with a simple in-memory API in Part2. Now, in Part3, we're summoning more powerful spirits:
- SQLAlchemy for persistent data storage with SQLite 🗄️
- JWT for secure authentication 🔐
- RBAC for ghostly permissions 👑
- Swagger UI for API documentation 📖

## 🧙‍♀️ Technical Choices
We've brewed a powerful potion using:
- **Poetry**: For magical dependency management
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Our quality guardians (still learning their mysterious ways!)
  - Black: The code formatter that brings order to chaos
  - isort: Keeps our imports as neat as a vampire's cape
  - flake8: Our strict but fair code quality enforcer

git commit -m "feat(crazy): Project Resurrection 👻

🧙‍♀️ Mad Hatter Style:
- rm -rf * (because why not?)
- Rebuilt project structure from ashes
- Recovered essential files from unic branch
- Added spooky logging structure

🎃 Structure:
- models/ (where ghosts live)
- api/ (their haunting grounds)
- tests/ (where we summon bugs)
- utils/ (our spell book)

⚰️ Next: Time to raise the dead (aka write some code)

Were all mad here! 🎩
